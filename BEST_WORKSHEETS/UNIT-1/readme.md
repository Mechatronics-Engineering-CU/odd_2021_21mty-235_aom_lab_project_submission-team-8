Section/Group: -A

#### Semester: 3  						                                        
##### Date of Performance: 14th October, 2021

### Subject Name: Applications of MATLAB                  
### Subject Code: 21O-20MTY-235

#### Aim/Overview of the practical: 

##### Design and Implement a GUI app for a Scientific Calculator that could perform the following operation: ðŸš€
1- Arithmetic 
2- Trigonometric
3- Logarithmic
4- Statistical Mean
2. Software required: MATLAB Software
##### Steps:
1- First create a Panel and re-size it.
2- Add different components from component library like; numeric field, text field, push buttons.
3- Then go to the Code view and edit it as the submitted code in the zip file named â€˜Code Matlab Exp-2â€™.
4- You can also convert that to the package app.

##### Output:ðŸ“Ÿ
![SCIENTIFIC-CALCULATOR](https://github.com/Mechatronics-Engineering-CU/Applications-of-Matlab/blob/main/DATA/SC_BY_ABHISHEK.png)

#### The created design successfully workedðŸš©
[CHECK OUT THE CODE HERE](https://github.com/Mechatronics-Engineering-CU/Applications-of-Matlab/blob/main/DATA/Code%20Matlab%20Exp-2.txt)

##### Result:
Learned more about GUI designing in MATLAB, which includes inserting components, editing components, writing the background code, how to save in format of package installer.
